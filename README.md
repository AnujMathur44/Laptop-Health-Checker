## Laptop Health Checker

This is a simple project I built to check the overall health of a laptop using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit**.  
It uses pre-trained models (`.pkl` files) to analyze input features and predict the health status of a laptop.

## What’s inside
- `app.py` → the main Streamlit app that runs the project  
- `.pkl` files → saved ML models and preprocessing files  

---

## How to run the project

1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open **CMD/Terminal** in the project folder (where `app.py` and `.pkl` files are located).  
3. Run the command:  

   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run app.py
